As Rick awoke one morning from uneasy dreams, he found his phones screen glowing. He grabbed his phone and...

"Dear Rick, I have to visit your aunt Irma tomorrow early in the morning. Therefore I need stay at your place tonight. I hope you're available to host me."

He is terrified by the text he's just seen on his phones screen. His mom wanted to stay overnight at his place. He'd prefer seeing a good morning message from his gf with a heart blowing kiss instead.

Untidyness of his room made him think about the consequences. Anyone would feel uneasy and have solid reasons to be nervous, if his room was their room.

"Shit, I have to tidy up this place before mom finds out what kind of person I am."

Why would he tidy up his room? Let's find it out.
