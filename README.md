## Why we made dis?
Sercan's flight was delayed and I was recovering from the flu that I caught last week.
We looked for a perfect spot, where our laptops can connect the Wi-Fi. Tasty Ratsherrn beer made finding ideas easy at the beginning, but later on we started to feel sleepy.

I wasn't even aware that this game genre -hidden object games- existed! As Sercan said, I have to play more games.

Well, submitting this one is better than submitting nothing :d

## How we made dis?
The clash of ideas started even before we found our perfect spot for development. Walking through the corridor multiple times supplied the blood flow to our brains... Well, not really. We basically wanted to finish dis ASAP and have fun. After some time he's put the "kaputt" drawing tablet aside and made it with good old mouse.
